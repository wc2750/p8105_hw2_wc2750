``` r
# load library
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

First, define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(path = path_to_data,
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             skip = 1
            ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate (year = 2018) %>%
  relocate (year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
             skip = 1
            ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate (year = 2017) %>%
  relocate (year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. The
total precipitaion in 2018 is 70.33. The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.
